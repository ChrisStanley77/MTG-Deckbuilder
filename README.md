## Description
---
</div>
<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This basic Magic The Gathering Deck Builder project was made in order to learn Microservices. Some of the technologies used in the project include Spring Boot, .NET (SDK 6), Docker, Docker-Compose, Eureka, Mongo, MSSQL, and basic HTML and Javascript for a throw together front end. This project has helped understand the basics of Service Oriented Architecture.
